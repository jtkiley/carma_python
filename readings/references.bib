  abstract = { This article proposes a three-step methodological
              framework called computational grounded theory, which combines
              expert human knowledge and hermeneutic skills with the processing
              power and pattern recognition of computers, producing a more
              methodologically rigorous but interpretive approach to content
              analysis. The first, pattern detection step, involves inductive
              computational exploration of text, using techniques such as
              unsupervised machine learning and word scores to help researchers
              to see novel patterns in their data. The second, pattern refinement
              step, returns to an interpretive engagement with the data through
              qualitative deep reading or further exploration of the data. The
              third, pattern confirmation step, assesses the inductively
              identified patterns using further computational and natural
              language processing techniques. The result is an efficient,
              rigorous, and fully reproducible computational grounded theory.
              This framework can be applied to any qualitative text as data,
              including transcribed speeches, interviews, open-ended survey data,
              or ethnographic field notes, and can address many potential
              research questions. }

  abstract = { In this study, we advance organizational impression
              management research by focusing on agent-oriented impression
              management—which reflects attempts to create value for the firm by
              publicizing individuals or groups who are agents of the firm.
              Although prevalent in practice, agent-oriented impression
              management remains unexplored in scholarly research. Specifically,
              we introduce the concept of new CEO prominence in firm
              communication (PFC), defined as the frequency and centrality of new
              CEO mentions in firm press releases and social media. We argue that
              new CEO PFC is distinct from traditional impression management
              tactics because CEOs are agents of the firm that will personally
              benefit from these impression management strategies. Thus, our
              research addresses the question: Who captures the value associated
              with new CEO PFC? We theorize that firms benefit from featuring new
              CEOs in firm communication through improved external stakeholder
              evaluations (i.e., analyst ratings). However, these efforts may
              also create value for the CEOs, as evidenced by increased
              compensation, more outside directorships, and decreased turnover
              rates. Our empirical study of efforts to publicize a new CEO
              following 557 succession events strongly supports our theory. }

              ensure fairness in authorship, which is one of the most powerful

  abstract = { Drawing on expectancy violation theory, we explore the
              effects of anticipatory impression management in the context of
              acquisitions. We introduce impression offsetting, an anticipatory
              impression management technique organizational leaders employ when
              they expect a focal event will negatively violate the expectations
              of external stakeholders. Accordingly, in these situations,
              organizational leaders will announce the focal event
              contemporaneously with positive, but unrelated information. We
              predict impression offsetting will generally occur in the context
              of acquisitions, but also more frequently for specific acquiring
              firms and acquisitions that are more likely to lead to an
              expectancy violation. We also posit that offsetting will
              effectively inhibit observers’ perceptions of events as negative
              expectancy violations by positively influencing shareholder
              reactions to acquisition announcements. Consistent with our
              hypotheses, in a sample of publicly traded acquisition targets, we
              find evidence for impression offsetting, in which characteristics
              of both acquirers and their announced acquisitions predict its
              frequency of use. We also find evidence that impression offsetting
              is efficacious; on average, it reduces the negative market reaction
              to acquisition announcements by over 40\%, which translates into
              approximately \$246 million in market capitalization. }

  abstract = { Increasingly, management researchers are using topic
              modeling, a new method borrowed from computer science, to reveal
              phenomenon-based constructs and grounded conceptual relationships
              in textual data. By conceptualizing topic modeling as the process
              of rendering constructs and conceptual relationships from textual
              data, we demonstrate how this new method can advance management
              scholarship without turning topic modeling into a black box of
              complex computer-driven algorithms. We begin by comparing features
              of topic modeling to related techniques (content analysis, grounded
              theorizing, and natural language processing). We then walk through
              the steps of rendering with topic modeling and apply rendering to
              management articles that draw on topic modeling. Doing so enables
              us to identify and discuss how topic modeling has advanced
              management theory in five areas: detecting novelty and emergence,
              developing inductive classification systems, understanding online
              audiences and products, analyzing frames and social movements, and
              understanding cultural dynamics. We conclude with a review of new
              topic modeling trends and revisit the role of researcher
              interpretation in a world of computer-driven textual analysis. }

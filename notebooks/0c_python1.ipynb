    "1. **Handling errors.** See the relevant Python [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions) on `try-except` clauses (which will handle most of what we tend to need in research). In particular, note what they say about using `except` without a specified exception (in other resources, this is often called a \"naked\" `except`). This will capture anything, including the exception that is raised when you use the Kernel:Interrupt Kernel menu item, and that isn't usually what you want."
